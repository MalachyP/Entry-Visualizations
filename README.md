Basically have filtered **out** the following rows:
- Had a deakin bonus > 0
- Had UQ tier of 1 or 2
- Entrance to the GAM 
-   NOTE: (for 2022 and 2023, could only filter by looking whether GAM appeared in the notes section) so
    potentially still some GAM people included that didn’t mention it in the notes
- Rural stream
- People that got offered a FFP
- Also have done plots with and without ANU bonus (basically filtering out those who have said they’ve   
  done masters / phd and those who haven’t)

Yet to do
- Include those who have a deakin bonus, but didn’t apply to deakin (so like UQ)
- Include people who got rejected at their interview uni but ended up getting a FFP somewhere else (still useful data)

Explanation of files
- BASIC PLOTS:
  - Interview / Offers basic, basically plots the gamsat vs gpa for people who did and didn’t get in. Doesn’t filter out BMP, but does for FFP
  - FFP places are only included if they only selected FFP and missed out on an interview
  - Uses the filtered dataset
  - Offer anu is basically to filter people with and without an anu bonus, to see the effect of masters / phd on results
- HISTOGRAMS
  - ONLY PLOTTING PEOPLE WHO GOT IN
  - Combo score is not scaled for something like deakin, but doesn’t matter as those applicants are filtered
- ALL folders
  - Basically are used to compare the results between the interview data and offers data, flicking back and forth
  - Used the data which included people with anu bonuses for histograms and scatter plots

Important notes:
- Massive class in balance. For melbourne, the true ratio of interviews to offers is something like 500 : 200, but in this case, the interviews to offers for melbourne is 120: 90 (people who got in only respond
  - This is why the histogram approach was taken, as massively biased to those who did get in, can’t really calculate the percentage of people who got in to a certain uni for a set of combo scores
- UQ isn’t differentiated by RMP or Metro for 2022, so have some pretty patchy results
- Am not including hidden rejections (those who say interview at unimelb as no.1 pref, then got rejected from no.2 pref say deakin, then got in Griffith as well as those who put unimelb as no.1 pref, then got rejected from all remaining preferences

Still unclear about
- The distribution of interview scores (like is it a bell curve or what?)
- How this fits in with anecdotal evidence
- IDK how preferences work / influence results
