Assumptions and uses
- uses component['props'].get('id') to find the component
- doesn't actually update the value in settings of a dynamic variable that's in use, because 
  open creation will have default values note
- Because there are no mixed types, (both potentially numbers and or strings), can just keep the nans
  in the data and safely convert to object (as string couldn't be intepreted any other way)
  - could have also created a function called convert with na to string, but oh well
  - the frame can be numpy, as the filter to options uses a convert numpy function anyway, and that's
    the only way different values could be brought in for the json
- Interview is set both in dcc.store as well as in the options for the layout (probably static filter creation)

- Shouldn't do the dcc.store (actions: graph) thing I don't reckon, as get finer control (over outputs and stuff)
  via the other methods (too generalized)

- Need to make sure the filter to options matches as well? (actually it's ok since will use the very same data frame),
  only problem was when creating different views

Explanatory notes
- UQ RMP only exists for 2023 onwards unforunately

Next Steps:
- Create the new graph generation layout. Includes
  - layout
  - Heading
  - Download button
  - Change legend
- Create a enable advanced filtering button

Another time
- Create a mark as outlier button for clicked data
- Sort by combo score
  - Add that in filtering

After that
- Create the histogram view

After that
- Image carousel


- Spend one hour with mums book
- Change the format to have
  - Dataset
  - Standard filters (exclude place filters)
  - Main graph (make it tighter)
  - Data below the graphs (able to toggle)
    - Sort the data by gamsat!!!
  - Advanced filtering
  - (spawns to the side)
- REMEMBER TO DO HISTOGRAM GRAPH!!!! (all this on Thursday)
- Read into how to do multiple pages
- CAN CLICK ON HISTOGRAM TO SO CHUNKS AS WELL!!!
- Then can create a new tab for image carousel
- Then can create a submit for page

TOMORROW
- Just try create the filtering again with the list attributes
- Create the click data if time permitted


- Basically include in the other stuff and remove none
- Create points and neaten up the graph
- Create click data

Current Thoughts
- Saturday: Can try get the filtering + graphing done that day
  - Create a outcome filter for notes
- Sunday: Display for the points and selection (creating red on the graph as well)
- Monday: Image Carousel P1
- Tuesday: Image Carousel P2
- Wednesday: Break
- Thursday: Image Carousel P3
- Friday: Styling
- Sunday: Doing the shit


General Thoughts:
- Stuff takes so much longer than expected, account for that


Future Ideas
- Graphing
  - Basically should callback to university option
  - Should be included in the data dictionary
  - Filtering function as well
  - reset axes button
- The additional settings toggle
  - can read from settings if toggled down
- User information
  - double clicking the graph to reset
    - information about lasso
